# Web Components Aren't .weird[Weird] Anymore

- Analogy (electric car maybe?)
- Tech is like that too

---

## Web Component Awesomeness

- "Just Works" - drop an element on a page, it's working
- Ship Less Code: tooling is in the browser now. Think `querySelectorAll` rather than jQuery
- Works across frameworks

---

## Web Component Weirdness

_Huge Polyfills_ - only natively supported in one browser. Slow in others

_Framework lock-in_ - Tied to polymer

_Tooling badness_ - bower, HTML Imports

No wonder React won the component wars

---

## It's Gotten Better

Browsers Implemented

Write "Vanilla" or use a framework (polymer, stencil, skate, lit-html, nutmeg, etc)

---

## You Can Use Your Frameworks

Angular elements, Vue exports, Dojo exports, React w/ a wrapper

Use them in frameworks - custom-elements-everywhere

---

## Others are using it

- GitHub
- YouTube
- Stellar
- UPRR

---

## Weird can be good

Just not for your components.
