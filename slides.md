# Web Components (nee Custom Elements)

--

## They Are Awesome

---

# Demo - Joy-Con component

---

# They Just Work
--

- They Work Easily
???
No compile or Webkit necessary
--

- They Work Fast
--

- `querySelectorAll` vs jQuery
--

- They Work Everywhere

# Write "Vanilla" Custom Elements

```javascript
class HelloWorld extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.render();
  }

  render() {
    this.innerHTML = `<div>Hello World!</div>`;
  }
}
customElements.define('hello-world', HelloWorld);
```

# Or add some sugar

### (polymer, stencil, skate, lit-html, nutmeg, etc)

---

# Stencil

* Code with TypeScript
* Use JSX
* Reactive Data Binding
* No Runtime

---

# Code example: joy-con

---

# Your framework exports them

* Angular Elements
* Vue
* Dojo
* React (with a wrapper)

---

# Use them in your apps

* Great as "leaf nodes"

---

# Or write entire apps with them

* Ionic's PWA Starter Kit
